This mini-game is a regular fire dodging game.
In creating this game, I learnt how to:
- Structuring components.
- Calculate gravity and apply it. 
- Use 2D assets to draw objects.
- Move backgrounds at different speeds.
- I also used the CheckCollisionRecs() function from the Raylib library, which allows you to calculate collisions without additional calculations, in the reaction mini-game, I did this to check and understand the objects. 

2D assets I dwonloaded from https://itch.io/game-assets
